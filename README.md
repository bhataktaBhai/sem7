# Semester 7 at IISc

I am crediting
- I don't know

I will try to audit
- I don't know

I will occasionally attend (when interesting)
- I don't know

The other courses in the file tree are a relic of the past,
when I was *even more* unsure of what to credit.

The code is a mess that is largely unrefactored from my first semester.
Venture into the source at your own risk.

## Compiling
I have no clue how relative paths work in LaTeX.
Change `~/IISc/sem7/` to `~/path/to/this/repo/` everywhere it is used.
I compile with latexmk using the VimTeX plugin for Neovim,
but there should be no trouble with any method.
